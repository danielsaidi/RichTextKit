RichTextKit has a multi-platform demo app that show how to use the library on multiple platforms.

The demo app can be explored from the [GitHub repository][GitHub]. It's a document-based app that runs on both macOS, iOS, and iPadOS and persists rich text files on disc.



## How to run the demo on device

The demo app has disabled code signing, to simplify its setup. 

You can run the demo app on any iOS and iPadOS simulator, as well as on macOS. To run it on a physical iOS or iPadOS device, you must set up code signing just like you would with any other app.
